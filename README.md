# Natural Language Preprocessing (NLPre)

NLPre is a text (pre)-processing library that helps smooth some of the inconsistencies found in real-world data.
Correcting for issues like random capitalization patterns, strange hyphenations, and abbreviations are essential parts of wrangling textual data but are often left to the user.
The library is developed by the [Office of Portfolio Analysis](https://dpcpsi.nih.gov/opa/aboutus) at the [National Institutes of Health](https://www.nih.gov/) and many of the utilities are designed to correct for historical artifacts in our data.
The goals of NLPre are a set of functions that can act in a pipeline independent of one another with a consistent and predictable result.

NLPre is part of the [`word2vec-pipeline`](https://github.com/NIHOPA/word2vec_pipeline).

### What's included?

| #What's included | |
| --- | --- |
| **dedash** | Test <br> Test \n When text is passed though a word-processor sometimes hyphenations with with newlines are inserted. This module attempts to correct the hyphenation pattern by joining words that if they appear in an English word list. |
| **decaps** | When text is passed though a word-processor sometimes hyphenations with with newlines are inserted. This module attempts to correct the hyphenation pattern by joining words that if they appear in an English word list. |

**dedash**

**decaps**

We presume that case is important, but only for complicated words like fMRI.
This module corrects casing by lowering all words with only one capital letter.

`Hello world` -> `hello world`

**remove_parenthesis**

Parentheticals (statements in parenthesis) are removed as long as
they are balanced.

**replace_from_dictionary**

Noun phrases from a predefined dictionary are replaced. The [MeSH](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/) dictionary comes included.

**replace_phrases**

Phrases found though an abbreviation finder (not included yet), are replaced.

**titlecaps**

WHY ARE SOME SENTENCES IN ALL CAPS? These sentences are converted to lower case.

**token_replacement**

Simple token replacement (% -> `percent`)

**pos_tokenizer**

Parts of speech are filtered out by using a white-list. 

**unidecoder**

Converts Unicode phrases into ASCII equivalent, (`Î²-sheet` -> `b-sheet`).

**identify_parenthetical_phrases**

`What is Health and Human Services (HHS)?` gets tokenized as `counter[(('Health', 'and', 'Human', 'Services'), 'HHS')]`
